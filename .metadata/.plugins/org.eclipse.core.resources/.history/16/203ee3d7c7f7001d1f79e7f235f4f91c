//	declare a variable to store a reference to a database connection that can be used by other methods in the DBUtils class. 
	
//	why is the following varaible static ?
//	By declaring it as static, the variable is shared across all instances of the class, ensuring that the same connection is used throughout the application's lifecycle.

	
	
	
//	write a static method to make/open a database connection
//	why only a static method btw why not a normal method ?
